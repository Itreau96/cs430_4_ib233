## Purpose ##

The purpose of this project is to extend our raycaster so that it will implement shading. We are adding a "light" object to our input 
capabilities as well as the ability to adjust the way shading affects the colors of our objects.

## Contents ##

The contents of the project repository are as follows:
- Source code written in C programming language
- A Makefile used to build the project
- Sample input/output files to be used with the sample build (input: test.csv, output: out.ppm)

## Usage ##

Steps to use: 

1. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
2. Type "make" into a command line interface.
3. Type ./raycast (width) (height) (in.csv) (out.ppm) into your command line with appropriate input variables to ouput a raycast image.

## Known Issues ##
